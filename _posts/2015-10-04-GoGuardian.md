For my [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) Project for the Fall Session of 2015 I opted to work with [GoGuardian](https://www.goguardian.com), a rapidly expanding educational startup based in Los Angeles. This startup developes a Chrome extension that is installed in student chrome books. 

This extension records the sites that students visit.
