title: Classifying Websites with GoGuardian
published: true
---

For my [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) Project for the Fall Session of 2015 I opted to work with [GoGuardian](https://www.goguardian.com), a rapidly expanding educational startup based in Los Angeles. This startup developes a Chrome extension that is installed in student chrome books. 

This extension records the sites that students visit. It allows for teachers and admistrators to monitor the types of websites that students visit, which can be used to gain insights into how student web site behavior might influence academic performance. In addition the app allows for teachers to filter out not safe for work websites. 

### The problem.
Being able to classify websites is crucial to GoGuardians mission.
