Biochemist | Systems and Sythetic Biologist | Data Scientist

### More Information
I've had an unusual career: I trained as a medical doctor and then a biochemist at UC San Francisco. Following that, I did a postdoc at UC San Diego in the fields of Synthetic and Systems biology. Finally I've slowly been morphing into a Data Scientist.
