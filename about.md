Biochemist | Systems and Sythetic Biologist | Data Scientist

### More Information
I've had an unusual career: I trained as a medical doctor and then a biochemist at [UC San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu) in the lab of [Dyche Mullins](http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/people/). Following that, I did a postdoc at UC San Diego in the fields of Synthetic and Systems biology. Finally I've slowly been morphing into a Data Scientist.
