Biochemist | Systems and Synthetic Biologist | Data Scientist

### More Information
I've had an unusual career; I trained as a medical doctor and then a biochemist at [UC San Francisco](https://www.ucsf.edu) in the lab of [Dyche Mullins](http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/people/), where I used biochemical and biophysical methods to study proteins driving DNA segregation in bacteria. Following that, I did a postdoc at UC San Diego in the fields of Synthetic and Systems biology in the lab of [Jeff Hasty](http://biodynamics.ucsd.edu). Currently, I've been slowly morphing into a Data Scientist and have been training as Data Scientist at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com).
